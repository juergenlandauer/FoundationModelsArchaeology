Test of foundation models on archaeological features

The repository contains five sub-folders for each of the five experiments we present:

Experiment:
#1: Detection of Bavarian castles in satellite imagery
#2: Detection of Cambodian temples in satellite imagery
#3: Detection of English hillforts in LiDAR
#4: Segmentation of English hillforts in LiDAR with SAM 2.1
#5: Potsherd detection in drone video with SAM 2.1

All programs are provided as Google Colab Notebooks. To run, click on the "Open in Colab" Button at the top, then click on "Runtime->Run all". If you want to use your own data, make sure you read the top part of the Notebook beforehand and follow the instructions for choosing parameters acoording to your data.

The folders also contain links to the data used for the experiments.
